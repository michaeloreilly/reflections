What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository tells Git which directory is going to have files
to track, and creates the subdirectory structure for tracking the change
metadata. You need to do it so that Git will have the framework it needs to
do its work on the files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains the files that you want to commit next. This allows
you to have granular control over exactly which files are changed in a particular
commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

By only staging files related to a specific logical change, you can make sure that
particular commit only pertains to that change.
